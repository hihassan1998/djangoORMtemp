# Standalone Django ORM Project Template

This project template provides a foundation for creating a standalone Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) project along with an app. It is designed to be used as a learning tool and starting point for building more complex Django ORM applications.

## Purpose

The main goal of this template is to help you understand and implement key concepts related to Django ORM, PostgreSQL (or Postgres), Psycopg, and database migrations. By using this template, you can explore how Django models map to database tables, work with PostgreSQL as the relational database management system, utilize Psycopg as the interface for PostgreSQL in Django, and manage database schema changes through migrations.

## Concepts Covered

### Django ORM

Django ORM is a powerful component of the Django web application framework. It provides an abstraction layer for interacting with databases, where each Django model corresponds to a database table. This template will guide you in creating and using Django models to define your database schema.

### PostgreSQL (Postgres)

PostgreSQL, often referred to as Postgres, is an open-source relational database management system. Django supports PostgreSQL as one of its database backends. This template is configured to work seamlessly with PostgreSQL, allowing you to leverage its features for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Psycopg

Psycopg is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python that enables Django to interact with PostgreSQL databases. It serves as the bridge between Django's ORM and the PostgreSQL database backend. You will explore how to set up and configure Psycopg to work with this template.

### Database Migrations

Database migrations are crucial for managing version-controlled, incremental, and reversible changes to relational database schemas. The template includes examples and instructions on how to create, apply, and revert migrations using Django's `manage.py` command-line interface.

### manage.py

Django provides a command-line interface through the `manage.py` script. This template emphasizes the usage of `manage.py` for various tasks, including running the development server, creating database migrations, applying migrations, and other project management tasks.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
3. Configure the database settings in the `settings.py` file.
4. Create your Django models in the `models.py` file.
5. Run initial migrations and apply them to set up the database schema.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and build upon it to create your Django ORM projects.
